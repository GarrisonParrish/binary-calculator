# binary-calculator

This is a simple calculator based on an earlier class project in C. I have a quiz on binary representation coming up
and I wanted to have an easy way to check my understanding.

## Eventually this project will have:
- A signed representation calculator
- One's complement (yes I know it's useless)
- Two's complement (Very much not useless)
- Floating point (IEEE 754)
- A GUI
